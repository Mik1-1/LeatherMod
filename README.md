A Minecraft mod that adds new ways to get leather and makes crafting more immersive.

How it works:

Craft a Butcherâ€™s Knife
You can make it with stone, iron, diamond, or netherite. Each one has durability and works like a tool.

Hit Cows, Hoglins or Horses with the butcher's knife
Youâ€™ll extract Raw Hide without killing them â€” a new item used to craft leather.

Dry the Raw Hide
Place it in a Campfire. After some time, it becomes Leather.

Turn Rotten Flesh into Leather
You can dry Rotten Flesh too, to get leather. Perfect for zombie farms.

Use Leather to craft tools or items
You can craft bandages that health you.
